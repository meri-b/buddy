# My Buddy

Welcome to the "My Buddy" project. This an assistive entertainment app built for Android.
It features activities for children and young adults to interact with, without the use of their hands or
any specific dictation. This app is designed to be set up by a caretaker for impaired people to use.

This project has only recently gone public! Right now, these docs are pretty thin and a work in progress.
